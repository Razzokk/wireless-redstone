	- Before: `<mcversion>-<version>`, e.g. `1.20.4-1.2.0`
    - After: `<version>+<mcversion>`, e.g. `1.2.0+1.20.4`
- Dev only
	- use [ParchmentMC](https://parchmentmc.org/) for mappings and adjust/re-write code accordingly
	- refactor code to be more in common module
	- improve project structure (multi-loader) with help of:
		- [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template)
		- [greenhouse-multiloader-template](https://github.com/GreenhouseModding/greenhouse-multiloader-template)

## [1.20.4-1.2.0-beta] - 2025-03-13

### Fixed

- Forge & NeoForge: redstone wires connecting up or down to transmitters/receivers
- Fabric: redstone wires connecting up or down to redstone utility blocks

### Added

- **P2P redstone transmitter** and **receiver** for direct wireless linkage
- **Linker** to link p2p transmitter and receiver
	- Similar to the sniffer, highlights the targeted block

### Changed

- Redstone transmitters and receivers now use the `cube_column` block model instead of `cube_bottom_top`
	- Why? The bottom and top textures have been the same since the initial release,
	  and the corresponding textures have also been removed.
	- If you have a custom resource pack for Wireless Redstone, you can still use the `cube_bottom_top` model,
	  but you will need to provide your own model files, see [Model](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Model).
- Highlight renderers now use the outline of the block instead of just a 1x1x1 block

## [1.20.4-1.1.5] - 2024-07-09

### Fixed

- Forge & NeoForge: race condition on client setup -> item property registration
- Dev only:
	- Forge: not starting in dev environment (module conflicts)

### Fixed

### Added

### Changed

- Updated german translation
- Moved block textures to their respective directories
	- If you have a custom resource pack for Wireless Redstone, you have to move and rename them too
- Sniffer chat messages:
	- Changed style of how block positions are shown in chat (can now also be adjusted in lang file)
	- From: `There are no active transmitters on this frequency (<frequency>)`,
	  to: `No active transmitters on frequency <frequency>`
	- From: `Active transmitters on this frequency (<frequency>): <transmitters>`,
	  to: `Active transmitters on frequency <frequency>: <transmitters>`

	- Separate datagen sub-project
